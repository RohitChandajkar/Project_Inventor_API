# Autodesk Inventor VBA Project: Create Sketch with Rectangles

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in Autodesk Inventor to create a new sketch containing rectangles using the two new center point rectangle commands provided by the Inventor API.

## Description

Autodesk Inventor provides a powerful API that allows developers to automate tasks, create custom features, and extend the functionality of Inventor. In this project, we utilize VBA to interact with the Inventor API to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Create a new sketch in the active part document.
2. Add rectangles to the sketch using the new center point rectangle commands provided by the Inventor API.

## Requirements

- Autodesk Inventor installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of VBA programming.
- Access to the Inventor Object Model.

## Usage

1. Open Autodesk Inventor.
2. Enable the VBA environment if not already enabled.
3. Create a new macro project or open an existing one.
4. Copy the provided VBA code into your project.
5. Run the macro to execute the code.
6. Verify that a new sketch containing rectangles is created in the active part document.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Autodesk Inventor.
3. Load the provided VBA project or create a new one.
4. Follow the instructions in the Usage section to run the macro and observe the results.
